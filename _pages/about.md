I enjoy working on water issues, particularly those related to urban hydrology and water management in urban environments. Currently a Graduate Research Assistant at University of Colorado Boulder in the Department of Civil, Environmental and Architectural Engineering, working at [Dr Aditi Bhaskar's lab](https://aditibhaskar.com/).
