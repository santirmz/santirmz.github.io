I enjoy working around water issues, particularly interested in urban hydrology and water management in urban environments. Currently a graduate research assistant at University of Colorado Boulder in the Department of Civil, Environmental and Architectural Engineering, working at [Dr Aditi Bhaskar's lab](https://aditibhaskar.com/).
